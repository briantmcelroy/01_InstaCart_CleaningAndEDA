# 01_InstaCart_CleaningAndEDA

## About this Project

The InstaCart CleaningAndEDA project looks at a synthetic dataset of online orders and highlights (1) how databased data should be cleaned after being loaded into a dataframe, and (2) how basic EDA can be performed to analyse data trends without the use of advanced Python libraries or machine learning. It is an effective introductory project to the realm of Python data pre-processing, with more attention paid to each step in the process than more advanced projects.

## Running it Yourself

The Jupyter notebook is self-contained and reflects the outputs of the code contained within. If you would like to connect to your own environment and run the notebook, or make changes on your own fork of the repo, you may do so after cloning. Make sure the environment is either based in the upper-level folder to which you clone the repo, or be sure to replace the dataset file references with a direct local reference to the /datasets/ folder on your machine. 

The project does not require any dependencies and is stable with Python 3.11.
